# Sentiment-Based Airbnb Price Forecasting

## About: <br>
- Developed a ML model for Airbnb hosts to ensure accurate property pricing and for customers to evaluate pricing fairness.
- Built a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on reviews.
- Utilized Databricks and PySpark to efficiently process a dataset of over 100,000 rows through distributed computing.
- Preprocessed reviews to improve data quality by removing stop words, applying snowball stemming, and other techniques.
- Experimented with feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, HashingTF), multiple ML algorithms, and fine-tuning of many hyperparameters to optimize model effectiveness.
