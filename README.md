# Sentiment-Based Airbnb Price Forecasting

## About: <br>
• Developed a pricing prediction model for Airbnb listings, categorized prices as GREAT, GOOD, or OK based on property
details, to assist Airbnb hosts in pricing their properties accurately and enable customers to evaluate pricing fairness.
• Built a NLP model to perform sentiment analysis on reviews, evaluating whether it is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
• Utilized Databricks, PySpark, and Python to efficiently process a dataset of 100,000+ rows through distributed computing.
• Preprocessed reviews to improve data quality by removing stop words, applying snowball stemming, and other techniques.
• Experimented with feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, HashingTF), multiple ML algorithms, and fine-tuning of many
hyperparameters to optimize model effectiveness.
