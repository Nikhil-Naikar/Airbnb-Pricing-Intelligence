Want to hear the new young musicians that people are excited about or the promising new artists - we'll tell you about them. The best restaurants - ask us.\r\nWant to take a break from the city we'll tell you about wilderness canoeing on the Delaware river - just an hour and a half's drive.

It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture.

Clean your dishes before you go to bed or go out. Any food trash goes in the small trash next to the sink, and recycling all goes in the big black can next to the fridge. No tobacco smoking inside.

We enjoy spending most of our time in Manhattan and coming home to our quiet residential neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant.   In fact, my profile photo captures Greg and I at Café Lalo on 83rd St , which is our favorite place for dessert. \r\n\r\nBeing a host is amazing.  I enjoy the privilege of meeting people from the world’s villages to major cities.  It’s wonderful to see my guests live in as New Yorkers and live out striding with enthusiasm to major attractions.  I like to hear my guest speak with their beautiful diverse languages and accents so lively.   \r\n\r\nFive things I cannot live without are love, wisdom, laughter, music, and God.  In these 5 things I posses everything I need for my life adventures, obstacles and the people I encounter along the way.\r\n\r\nThe New York Botanical Garden is my oasis in the crowded city.  Although the New York Botanical Garden is located in the Bronx, it’s a quick and simple commute via A Train , 4/5 Express subways and then to the Metro North Railroad at Grand Central Station.   Even though I live 15 minutes from the spectacular Brooklyn Botanical Garden, I prefer the New York Botanical Garden.  \r\n\r\nDuring your New York City getaway, if you have a few days to spare, you should not miss out on an upstate excursion to Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls (both Canadian and American sides) is one of my favorite travel destinations and beholds a breathtaking view year around.

We enjoy spending most of our time in Manhattan and coming home to our quiet residential neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant.   In fact, my profile photo captures Greg and I at Café Lalo on 83rd St , which is our favorite place for dessert. \r\n\r\nBeing a host is amazing.  I enjoy the privilege of meeting people from the world’s villages to major cities.  It’s wonderful to see my guests live in as New Yorkers and live out striding with enthusiasm to major attractions.  I like to hear my guest speak with their beautiful diverse languages and accents so lively.   \r\n\r\nFive things I cannot live without are love, wisdom, laughter, music, and God.  In these 5 things I posses everything I need for my life adventures, obstacles and the people I encounter along the way.\r\n\r\nThe New York Botanical Garden is my oasis in the crowded city.  Although the New York Botanical Garden is located in the Bronx, it’s a quick and simple commute via A Train , 4/5 Express subways and then to the Metro North Railroad at Grand Central Station.   Even though I live 15 minutes from the spectacular Brooklyn Botanical Garden, I prefer the New York Botanical Garden.  \r\n\r\nDuring your New York City getaway, if you have a few days to spare, you should not miss out on an upstate excursion to Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls (both Canadian and American sides) is one of my favorite travel destinations and beholds a breathtaking view year around.   In the summer through fall, The maid of the mist boat ride is an up close encounter with the beauty and power of nature.  At the Marineland theme park nearby, you can see the awesome view of the falls from some of the rides.  Another travel destination favorite of mine is an ambience of luxury and nature.  The Kidini Village at Disney World’s Animal Kingdom Villa is relaxing with quality accommodations, including stunning views of giraffe and other wildlife from your balcony. \r\n\r\nMy favorite movies are the Lord Of the Rings trilogy, Gladiator, The Color Purple and Coming to America – My Classics.  I don’t watch much TV but lately in season, I keep Dexter, True Blood, an Ancient Aliens recorded on my DVR.\r\n\r\nJazz, blues, gospel and classical music are my favorite genres of music.\r\n\r\nWhether fast food or fine dining, my favorite foods must be fresh and full of flavor: Soul Food, Caribbean, Mexican, Italian, Sushi, and customize green salads are my palate’s delight.\r\n\r\nI enjoy reading ancient astronaut theory, as well as African, Native Indian, and Biblical literature, history and mythology.\r\n\r\nMy life motto is to let your light shine.  \r\n","within a day","100%","N/A","f","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/59777/profile_pic/1319914807/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/59777/profile_pic/1319914807/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Bedford-Stuyvesant",6,6,"['phone', 'reviews']","t","f","Brooklyn, NY, United States",null,"Bedford-Stuyvesant","Brooklyn","Brooklyn","NY","11221","New York","Brooklyn, NY","US","United States",40.68493229454699,-73.9316610388113,"t","Apartment","Private room",2,1.0,1,2,"Real Bed","{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen}",null,"$59.00",null,"$1,092.00","$200.00","$95.00",1,"$0.00",2,29,"a week ago","t",0,0,0,219,"2018-09-08",5,"2010-09-25","2012-06-12",90,9,10,10,10,8,9,"f",null,null,"f","f","strict_14_with_grace_period","f","f",6,0.05],[17092,"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17092",20180908060534,"2018-09-08","Cool Room in Hell's Kitchen","This comfy and cozy room is located in the heart of the city in a quiet building.

It still has a bit of graffiti and grit and is full of vibrant ethnic enclaves but is very safe and you simply won't find a younger, funner place in NYC. The apartment is steps to great restaurants (probably the best in the city), bars (definitely the best in the city), cafes, and anything else you could want.  Within a few minutes' walk you'll find: a huge arcade bar, a whiskey-slash-grilled-cheese bar, the most famous steakhouse in the country, dirt-cheap dives, incredible speakeasy cocktail bars, and the best pizza place in NYC.","Please have a great time! And even though the area is lively and a lot of fun, the apartment itself is VERY quiet, in case that's a concern.

It runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is quick and very safe—even late at night. You can get just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Union Square is about 10 minutes away, the East Village about 7 minutes. It really is about as convenient a location as you'll find for getting around.  We also have several CitiBike bike-share stations within steps of the building. For $10 a day (or a longer-term subscription), you get unlimited access to these bikes, parked throughout the entire city.  The neighborhood itself is also very walkable, with tons to do, eat, shop, and drink in the immediate vicinity. Be like the locals and walk!","Guests have access to an enormous and beautiful apartment in a great part of town, steps from the subway. Your private room has a private balcony, and is on a completely separate floor from where I sleep (meaning tons of privacy). You have your own bathroom, access to the kitchen, living room, and pretty much whatever else you like. You can come and go as you please, 24 hours a day, and you won't disturb me. It will feel almost like a private apartment. I also offer free laundry drop-off service for guests staying at least six nights.","That's up to you! If you'd rather I didn't exist, I understand. If you want to grab a beer and talk about your trip and getting the most out of NYC, I'm happy to (assuming I'm not slammed with work)!

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.\n\nIn NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels. We hope to do the same for you!","within an hour","100%","N/A","f","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Clinton Hill",4,4,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']","t","t","Brooklyn, NY, United States","Clinton Hill","Clinton Hill","Brooklyn","Brooklyn","NY","11238","New York","Brooklyn, NY","US","United States",40.68630021383355,-73.96764761961074,"t","Condominium","Private room",3,1.5,1,2,"Real Bed","{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Pets allowed\",\"Pets live on this property\",\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Lock on bedroom door\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\",Other}",550,"$135.00",null,null,"$250.00","$85.00",2,"$35.00",4,730,"5 weeks ago","t",22,52,82,357,"2018-09-08",69,"2010-08-07","2018-07-29",96,10,10,10,10,10,9,"f",null,null,"f","f","strict_14_with_grace_period","f","f",3,0.7],[32100,"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32100",20180908060534,"2018-09-08","Modern Greenpoint, Brooklyn Apt","Our spacious three-bedroom modern apartment in hip Greenpoint is just waiting for you!

There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix. The street is urban for sure but very safe. My building is filled with young professionals, creative types - one married co</td><td>This is my personal apartment. It's not a business. It's not a hotel. It's not perfect. I host often and keep up with my place because of that. I try to keep it as clean as possible. However, it does have imperfections like anyone's home. If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)</td><td>F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park. It's the best train! :)</td><td>Guests have access to the whole apartment.</td><td>This listing is for the whole apartment I will not be staying there.

To microwave, simply press the Micro Express button.  Keep pressing it if you want to increase the amount of time, it will keep incrementing by 30 seconds. -- Garbage is in the basement.

The back room gets lots of light with windows on two sides (blinds on the windows to keep out the light in the am).  It has a 26\" HD TV with remote control, clock radio, hair dryer,  desk lamp and overhead light/ceiling fan, A/C and a small desk & chair for you</td><td>none</td><td>It's green, near two parks including the great Central Park, has beautiful old pre-war buildings and brownstones.</td><td>If you are noise sensitive, you may want to pack some earplugs for sleeping.  If you can't tolerate noise at all, this place is not for you.  My windows are charming pre-war windows, but pre-war builders did not know the meaning of \"soundproof\" when it came to window design. :)  If it's summertime and you have the A/C on, that will help block out any noise.</td><td>subway transportation is within a 2 min. walk. Buses are outside the door north and south; crosstown is a two minute walk.</td><td>Kitchen, living room, dining area. Shared bathroom in the apt. You may not use my computers - bring your own devices (wi-fi provided) or you can pay for computer time at a store nearby.</td><td>I look forward to meeting my guests and finding out a little about their lives.  Sometimes we have breakfast, a meal or a drink together.</td><td>No outside shoes in the house. I ask all guests to remove their outdoor shoes upon entering, so you may want to bring your house slippers. No smoking.  No pets.  No heavy perfume or aftershave please - I have allergies. No snoring.... (I'm kidding!  Just wanted to see if you were reading this :) Please only eat in the living room and preferably at the table, not on the sofa! No food in the back room. Any stains, food on floor of bedrooms, etc. will result in holding back of your security deposit. You need a LOW PROFILE to stay here.  If you don't know what that means, please ask.

Your windows face the rising sun, and blackout shades installed ensure a good night's rest no matter how sensitive to light you may be as a sleeper. There's ample closet and drawer space, electrical outlets within easy reach.

Historic districts, a hilltop park designed by Olmsted & Vaux, cutting-edge art and up-and-coming chefs, a pedigreed college and a repurposed hub for homegrown industry—all can be found here. And getting to, from and around the area has never been easier: the many subway lines servicing Atlantic Terminal deliver you to BAM's doorstep, and the G and C subway lines make stops in both neighborhoods. Add the more than 20 Citi Bike stations available throughout the area, and you have what may be Brooklyn's ideal day trip. The two neighborhoods' elegant rows of brownstones are popular with film crews—you may well stumble across a production in progress as you wander along tree-lined Willoughby Avenue or stroll past the boutiques and restaurants on Dekalb Avenue.

Buses are also close at hand, with several lines serving the streets adjacent to us.

Hi, I'm Seth. I'm here to make sure you have the best stay in New York possible. Looking to make th</td><td>none</td><td>Williamsburg has become world-famous for its fun, bars, restaurants, music venues, and general (once-)bohemian atmosphere. It still has a bit of graffiti and grit and is full of vibrant ethnic enclaves but is very safe and you simply won't find a younger, funner place in NYC. The apartment is steps to great restaurants (probably the best in the city), bars (definitely the best in the city), cafes, and anything else you could want.  Within a few minutes' walk you'll find: a huge arcade bar, a whiskey-slash-grilled-cheese bar, the most famous steakhouse in the country, dirt-cheap dives, incredible speakeasy cocktail bars, and the best pizza place in NYC.</td><td>Please have a great time! And even though the area is lively and a lot of fun, the apartment itself is VERY quiet, in case that's a concern. Oh, and while it's a walk-up, I'm happy to help with luggage if I'm home.</td><td>The subway (L train) is literally around the corner (you don't even need to cross the street). It runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is quick and very safe—even late at night. You can get just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Union Square is about 10 minutes away, the East Village about 7 minutes. It really is about as convenient a location as you'll find for getting around.  We also have several CitiBike bike-share stations within steps of the building. For $10 a day (or a longer-term subscription), you get unlimited access to these bikes, parked throughout the entire city.  The neighborhood itself is also very walkable, with tons to do, eat, shop, and drink in the immediate vicinity. Be like the locals and walk!</td><td>Guests have access to an enormous and beautiful apartment in a great part of town, steps from the subway. Your private room has a private balcony, and is on a completely separate floor from where I sleep (meaning tons of privacy). You have your own bathroom, access to the kitchen, living room, and pretty much whatever else you like. You can come and go as you please, 24 hours a day, and you won't disturb me. It will feel almost like a private apartment. I also offer free laundry drop-off service for guests staying at least six nights.</td><td>That's up to you! If you'd rather I didn't exist, I understand. If you want to grab a beer and talk about your trip and getting the most out of NYC, I'm happy to (assuming I'm not slammed with work)! There are also occasions when I have to travel at the last minute. So if I have to skip town for work, I apologize, and hope you enjoy the private apartment!</td><td>It's all pretty much common sense! -Even if Instant Book is on, please read the entire listing before booking and message me that all looks good. You'll see why I ask at the end! (And please don't be surprised there are stairs!) -Before booking, please fill out your profile and add a real photo! And please message me a bit about yourself and the nature of your trip. -Please take shoes off inside. It's just better that way. -Please don't smoke inside. You have a balcony for this, but please close the door so smoke doesn't drift inside and don't throw your butts down below (people live down there!) -No parties, or unregistered visitors. -Please clean up after yourself. No need to hand-wash dishes (can just toss them in the dishwasher and I'll handle); except for pans, chef's knives, and wood things.  -No guests under 18. -Be a nice person who understands that Airbnb is not a hotel--and view the fact that you aren't in one as a good thing!</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/49d1a658-d60b-4ed1-8709-f4fade8dda1e.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>97219</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/97219</td><td>Seth</td><td>2010-03-22</td><td>Beacon, New York, United States</td><td>Hey there.

Also, Wifi, clean towels and sheets will be provided. Very well maintained and friendly building.  Great neighbors and neighborhood with several restaurants, bars and cafes nearby.  Tree lined street with cute coffee shops.  Taxi, subway and bus stop readily available and close.   I use this space as my office as well as my apartment.  So the furnishings are a queen sized bed and three white desks.  The city and its many parks are my lounge and my family room, so to speak.

Therefore Airbnb's system will not calculate the correct guest numbers and accommodation fee when they're under 2's included. To manually override this, enter children under 2 as though they were in the 2-12 category.

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.\n","\n","In NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels. We hope to do the same for you!</td><td>within an hour</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Brooklyn, NY, United States</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>NY</td><td>11238</td><td>New York</td><td>Brooklyn, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.68630021383355</td><td>-73.96764761961074</td><td>t</td><td>Condominium</td><td>Private room</td><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Pets allowed\",\"Pets live on this property\",\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Lock on bedroom door\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\",Other}</td><td>550</td><td>$135.00</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>$250.00</td><td>$85.00</td><td>2</td><td>$35.00</td><td>4</td><td>730</td><td>5 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>22</td><td>52</td><td>82</td><td>357</td><td>2018-09-08</td><td>69</td><td>2010-08-07</td><td>2018-07-29</td><td>96</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>3</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>32100</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32100</td><td>20180908060534</td><td>2018-09-08</td><td>Modern Greenpoint, Brooklyn Apt</td><td>Our spacious three-bedroom modern apartment in hip Greenpoint is just waiting for you!

There is space to set up either an air mattress (single or double) and to a desk to set-up a laptop.  The walk-in closet, located, inexplicably, off of the living room, will be closed and locked.</td><td>I rent out my apartment over the holidays and holiday weekens when I'm away, so, I'll meet you and hand off keys and that's the last you'll see of me.</td><td>Absolutely no smoking.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c95ec44b-6494-48f4-bf97-f127adb94f30.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>139874</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/139874</td><td>Sarah</td><td>2010-06-07</td><td>New York, New York, United States</td><td>null</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/139874/profile_pic/1275925105/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/139874/profile_pic/1275925105/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Boerum Hill</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>Brooklyn, NY, United States</td><td>Boerum Hill</td><td>Cobble Hill</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>NY</td><td>11201</td><td>New York</td><td>Brooklyn, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.68570412520105</td><td>-73.99182715451813</td><td>t</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>3</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Shampoo,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\"}</td><td>600</td><td>$140.00</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>$60.00</td><td>2</td><td>$0.00</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>25 months ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2018-09-08</td><td>4</td><td>2010-09-06</td><td>2016-04-24</td><td>90</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>moderate</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>32363</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32363</td><td>20180908060534</td><td>2018-09-08</td><td>Fully Furnished Basement Apartment</td><td>You’ll love my place as it has its own private entrance, fully self contained, very bright and very cozy.
